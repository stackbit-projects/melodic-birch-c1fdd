## Hello World.

*   **Juggling Algorithm**

     In case of Array Rotations , apart from the conventional techniques, we can utilize the GCD technique, where in we would find the GCD if the array size and the number of elements to be rotated.

*   Ex. GCD(12,5) = 1, GCD(24,4) = 4.

*   And let's suppose the array to be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12] and n = 3; therefore GCD(12,3) = 3

*   Divide the list into 3 sets and rotate it by using them.
